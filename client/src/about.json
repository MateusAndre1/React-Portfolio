    "about": "Full Stack Web Developer and graduate from UCF Coding Bootcamp. Being a natural problem solver gave me a huge passion for being a developer, fixing broken code is something I have greatly enjoyed as there's no error I haven't been able to come up with a solution for. Among the many other things I love is how much collaboration is involved in making a perfect app, working with others not only helps you to improve but also gives the same opportunities for others.",
