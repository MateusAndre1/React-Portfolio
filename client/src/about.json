    "about": "Full Stack Web Developer and graduate from UCF Coding Bootcamp. Having an immense passion for coding since I was younger, I have been able to quickly pick up on newer languages and adopt them into my skills. Being a natural problem solver has also hugely helped me fix broken code since I do not give up until I find or create a solution. Among the many other things I love is how much collaboration is involved in making a perfect app, working with others not only helps you to improve but also gives the same opportunities for others.",
